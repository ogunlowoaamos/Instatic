/**
 * CMS handler entry point.
 *
 * `handleCmsRequest` is invoked by `server/router.ts` for every request
 * whose path starts with `/admin/api/cms/`. It does two things in order:
 *
 *  1. Defense-in-depth CSRF: state-changing methods (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
 *     must come from an Origin that matches the request's own origin (or
 *     a dev allowlist entry). `SameSite=Lax` already covers most CSRF;
 *     this catches the same-site-different-subdomain edge case before
 *     any handler runs.
 *
 *  2. Dispatch to the route-group handlers in `./<group>.ts`. Each group
 *     module owns its URL matching and returns either a `Response` (it
 *     handled the request) or `null` (not my route — try the next group).
 *     The first group to return a `Response` wins; if every group passes,
 *     we fall through to a 404.
 *
 * Routes are not nested into a tree because the prefix is short
 * (`/admin/api/cms/`) and each group's match logic is small enough that
 * a simple ordered chain is faster *and* easier to read than a router
 * abstraction with config objects. New route groups just need a new
 * file in this directory and one entry in `routeGroups` below.
 *
 * Loop traffic (`/_pb/loop/...`) lives next door in `./loop.ts` and is
 * dispatched directly by the top-level router, not through this entry
 * point — its prefix is outside `/admin/api/cms/`.
