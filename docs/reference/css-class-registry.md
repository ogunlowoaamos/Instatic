# Style Rule Registry (formerly CSS Class Registry)

The site's style rule registry — `Record<string, StyleRule>` stored on the site shell (`site.styleRules`). Every user-defined CSS rule lives here. The publisher compiles entries to CSS at publish time; the editor's canvas injects the same CSS for live preview.

Two kinds of rules:

1. **Author-facing class rules** (`kind: 'class'`) — the user picks a name (`hero-button`, `card-meta`) and the editor applies them via `node.classIds`. Selector is `.<name>`.
2. **Ambient rules** (`kind: 'ambient'`) — attach by CSS selector matching, not by node assignment (e.g. `h1`, `.hero .title`, `a:hover`). The publisher emits the rule but never writes to `class=` attributes.
3. **Scoped classes** — generated class-kind rules owned by a single node (for "set this property only on this element"). The scope object pins the rule to its node.

---

## TL;DR

- Stored on `SiteShell.styleRules: Record<string, StyleRule>`.
- Source-of-truth schema: `StyleRuleSchema` in `src/core/page-tree/styleRule.ts`.
- Compiled to CSS by `classCss.ts` in the publisher; collected via `collectClassCSS(site)`.
- Each node references class-kind rules by id (`node.classIds: string[]`). Later ids in the array win in cascade order.
- Selector UI surfaces display the rule's CSS selector (`styleRuleSelector(rule)`): class-kind rules appear as `.<name>`, ambient rules appear as their verbatim `selector` text.
- Rule **name** is the class token for class-kind rules. For ambient rules, `selector` is the source of truth; user edits keep `name` aligned to the selector so old class-name-only UI paths cannot add an extra dot.
- Rule **id** is the stable internal identifier (`<nanoid>`).
- Scoped rules (`scope: { type: 'node', nodeId, role: 'module-style' }`) are pinned to one node.
- Generated rules (framework-emitted spacing utilities, etc.) are flagged on `generated` so the Properties panel selector picker can filter them out by default.

## The `StyleRule` shape

```ts
interface StyleRule {
  id:           string                              // nanoid, stable across renames
  name:         string                              // class token for class rules; selector mirror for ambient rules
  kind:         'class' | 'ambient'                // discriminator
  selector:     string                              // CSS selector (e.g. '.hero-button' or 'h1 > span')
  order:        number                              // cascade order; rules sorted ascending by this
  description?: string
  scope?: {
    type:   'node'
    nodeId: string
    role:   'module-style'
  }
  styles:           Record<string, unknown>          // base CSS properties (CSSPropertyBag-shaped at write time)
  contextStyles:     Record<string, Record<string, unknown>>  // per-context overrides, keyed by context id
  generated?:    GeneratedClassMetadata               // framework-generated flags
  createdAt?:   number
  updatedAt?:   number
}
```

`contextStyles` is the **unified editing-context map** (see [docs/plans/2026-05-30-unified-condition-axis.md](../plans/2026-05-30-unified-condition-axis.md)). Each key is a *context id* that is **either**:

- a **width breakpoint id** (from `site.breakpoints`) → the publisher emits `@media (max-width: Npx)`; **or**
- a **custom condition id** (from `site.conditions`, the reusable `@media`/`@container`/`@supports` registry) → the publisher emits that condition's `@`-prelude.

This one map replaces the old split between `breakpointStyles` (width breakpoints) and `conditionalLayers` (everything else) — they were the same axis modelled twice. `parseStyleRule` migrates both legacy fields into `contextStyles`; the site-level `conditions` registry is reconstructed from legacy `conditionalLayers` in `parseSiteDocument`.

`styles` and `contextStyles` are typed `Record<string, unknown>` at the persistence boundary — narrowing happens at the publisher's `bagToCSS` (`classCss.ts`). The WRITE API (class slice, framework generators) uses the typed `CSSPropertyBag` shape from `src/core/page-tree/cssPropertyBag.ts`.

---

## Naming

Class-kind rule **name** is the public class token. It is stored without the leading dot; selector-facing UI renders it through `styleRuleSelector(rule)`, so users see `.hero-button` while node `class=` output stays `hero-button`. `assertValidCssClassName(name)` enforces:

- Required, after trimming at creation/rename boundaries
- No leading, trailing, or embedded ASCII whitespace
- No control characters

The selector itself is produced by `classKindSelector(name)`, which escapes the token for CSS when needed. Ambient rule **name** mirrors the ambient selector after user edits so older class-name-only surfaces cannot accidentally render an extra leading dot.

Rule **id** is internal (a nanoid). Refs from nodes (`classIds`) and from internal data structures use the id, not the name. This means renaming a rule doesn't break anything that references it.

Plugin-shipped rules are namespaced under the plugin id: `acme.template/hero-root`. See [docs/features/plugin-system.md](../features/plugin-system.md) (the pack section).

---

## Assigning class rules to nodes

```ts
interface PageNode {
  // ...
  classIds: string[]    // ordered; later ids win in CSS cascade
}
```

Only `kind: 'class'` rules are assigned via `classIds`. Ambient rules (`kind: 'ambient'`) attach by CSS matching and never appear in `classIds`.

The right Properties Panel exposes this through a unified selector picker:

- assigned class-kind rules appear as removable `TagPill` chips and add / remove entries from `node.classIds`;
- matching ambient rules appear as non-removable `TagPill` chips because they affect the selected element through CSS matching;
- non-matching ambient rules still appear in the dropdown, disabled with a "doesn't match this element" reason, so the user can see why the rule is not currently active.
- class-kind pills and suggestion rows show the leading dot (`.hero-button`) because they are CSS selectors, not plain labels.
- selector creation uses one input path. `classifySelectorCreateInput` treats one class token (`hero-button` or `.hero-button`) as a class-kind rule and selector-shaped input (`h1`, `.hero .title`, `a:hover`) as an ambient rule.

The picker decides ambient matches against the selected live canvas element as the selector subject (`element.matches(selector)`). A selector such as `.hero .title` appears when the selected element is `.title`, not when the selected element is the `.hero` ancestor. Supported trailing pseudo-state selectors (`:hover`, `:focus`, `:focus-visible`, `:active`) are surfaced as inactive matches by stripping the trailing pseudo and testing the base selector.

Class order matters — drag-reorder is supported for assigned class pills.

At render time, `classNamesForClassIds(classIds, registry)` returns the rendered class names that go onto the element's `class=` attribute. `injectNodeClassIds(html, node, site)` in the publisher splices them into the root tag.

When the user selects a rule from the Selectors Panel, the Properties Panel enters **selector-editing mode** — the panel body shows style controls for that rule instead of a page node. The panel header renders `SelectorHeader`, which displays the rule's CSS selector and (for non-generated, non-locked rules) provides inline rename and delete actions. Delete opens `DeleteSelectorDialog` for confirmation. Both actions are gated by `canEditStyle && !isGeneratedClassLocked(cls)`.

---

## Compiling rules to CSS

`collectClassCSS(site)` walks the style rule registry and emits CSS for each entry. Rules are sorted by `order` ascending so later, more-specific overrides appear later in source and win on equal specificity.

```text
For each rule in registry (sorted by order):
  selector = rule.selector               // e.g. '.hero-button' or 'h1 > span'
  base CSS  = bagToCSS(rule.styles)
  emit:     '${selector} { ${base CSS} }'

  for each (contextId, bag) in rule.contextStyles:
    if contextId is a custom condition (site.conditions):  // emitted first
      prelude = '@media <query>' | '@container [name] (<query>)' | '@supports (<query>)'
    else if contextId is a width breakpoint (site.breakpoints):  // emitted after, width-sorted
      prelude = '@media (max-width: ${width}px)'
    else:  // orphaned key — skipped
      continue
    emit: '${prelude} { ${selector} { ${bagToCSS(bag)} } }'
```

Cascade order within a rule: base → custom conditions (registry order) → width breakpoints (widest first, narrowest last).

The compiled string is part of the per-page CSS bundle (see [docs/features/publisher.md](../features/publisher.md) → CSS pipeline).

### `bagToCSS`

Translates the property bag (`{ color: '#fff', padding: { top: 16, right: 8 } }`) to CSS strings. Handles:

- Plain values: `color: #fff;`
- Spacing bags: `padding: 16px 8px 0 0;` (decomposed)
- Variable references: `color: var(--site-primary);`
- Multi-value props (transforms, transitions): joined per CSS rules

Invalid entries are silently dropped — the bag is tolerant.

---

## Scoped rules

A scoped rule is **owned by one node**. Its scope object pins it to that node's id and a role:

```ts
{
  id:    'class-abc',
  name:  '__pb_scope_<nodeId>',          // generated, never user-facing
  kind:  'class',
  selector: '.__pb_scope_<nodeId>',
  order: 0,
  scope: { type: 'node', nodeId: 'node-xyz', role: 'module-style' },
  styles: { 'border-radius': '12px' },
}
```

When the publisher emits the selector, it generates a uniquely-prefixed name so it can't be applied accidentally elsewhere:

```css
[data-node-id="node-xyz"].__pb_scope_node-xyz {
  border-radius: 12px;
}
```

Use scoped rules when you want **per-node styling** without polluting the global class palette. The Properties Panel exposes this via "Edit only this element" controls.

### Duplicating nodes with scoped rules

When a node is duplicated, its scoped rules need fresh ids that point at the duplicated nodes (not the originals). `cloneScopedClassesForNodeMap(scopedRules, oldToNewIdMap)` rewrites them in one pass.

Called by `duplicateNode` and `pasteSubtree` in `src/core/page-tree/mutations.ts`.

---

## Generated rules (framework + plugin)

A "generated" rule is one the codebase emits programmatically — typically the spacing scale utilities (`.pad-1`, `.pad-2`, ...) or the typography scale. They have `generated.origin === 'framework'` with family/step tags.

`classUtils.ts`:

```ts
isUserVisibleClass(cls)        // false for generated rules — hides them from the selector picker by default
isGeneratedClass(cls)          // true if `generated.origin === 'framework'`
isGeneratedClassLocked(cls)    // true if the rule is locked from manual edit (the framework owns its styles)
generatedClassKindLabel(cls)   // e.g. 'Spacing', 'Typography' — for grouping in selector-picker rows
```

The framework regenerates these rules whenever the user changes the framework scale (Site → Framework → Scale panel). Users can opt to show them in the selector picker via Settings → Editor → Show framework-generated classes.

---

## Tolerant parse

`parseStyleRule(raw)` is tolerant — it never throws. Invalid `scope` shapes drop silently; missing `styles` falls back to `{}`; missing `id` or `name` makes the whole entry skip. `parseStyleRuleRegistry(raw)` walks an entire registry and filters out invalid entries.

This is what makes the editor robust against partially-corrupt persisted data — a single broken rule doesn't break the whole site load.

The tolerant parser also backfills `kind`, `selector`, and `order` on old persisted shells that predate the selectors system.

Hard parsing (throws on shape mismatch) uses `Value.Parse(StyleRuleSchema, raw)` directly. The persistence layer uses the tolerant path so the editor can render even with garbage entries.

## Cookbook

### Create a class-kind rule

```ts
import type { StyleRule } from '@core/page-tree'
import { classKindSelector } from '@core/page-tree'
import { useEditorStore } from '@site/store/store'

const name = 'hero-button'
const rule = useEditorStore.getState().createClass(name, {
  'background-color': 'var(--site-primary)',
  'padding':          { top: 12, right: 24, bottom: 12, left: 24 },
  'border-radius':    '8px',
})

// Equivalent persisted shape:
const persistedRule: StyleRule = {
  id:       rule.id,
  name,
  kind:     'class',
  selector: classKindSelector(name),
  order:    rule.order,
  styles: {
    'background-color': 'var(--site-primary)',
    'padding':          { top: 12, right: 24, bottom: 12, left: 24 },
    'border-radius':    '8px',
  },
  contextStyles: {},
}
```

The rule is added to `site.styleRules`. The publisher emits CSS for it on next publish.

### Assign a class rule to a node

```ts
const rule = useEditorStore.getState().createClass('hero-button')
useEditorStore.getState().setNodeClassIds(nodeId, [rule.id])
```

The class names appear on the rendered element via `classNamesForClassIds`.

### Per-context styles (breakpoints + custom conditions)

```ts
{
  id:    'card',
  name:  'card',
  kind:  'class',
  selector: '.card',
  order: 0,
  styles:        { padding: 16, 'border-radius': 8 },
  contextStyles: {
    mobile:  { padding: 8 },                       // width breakpoint id
    desktop: { padding: 24 },                      // width breakpoint id
    'media:(orientation: landscape)': { padding: 12 },  // custom condition id (site.conditions)
  },
}
```

The publisher wraps each context block in the matching `@media (max-width: …)` (width breakpoint) or the custom condition's `@media`/`@container`/`@supports` prelude.

### Scoped rule for one node

The Properties Panel's "Custom" tab generates a scoped rule automatically when the user sets a property only on that node. Internally:

```ts
const name = `__pb_scope_${nodeId}`
const scoped: StyleRule = {
  id:       nanoid(),
  name,
  kind:     'class',
  selector: classKindSelector(name),
  order:    0,
  scope: { type: 'node', nodeId, role: 'module-style' },
  styles: { 'border-radius': '12px' },
}
useEditorStore.getState().createClass(scoped)
useEditorStore.getState().setNodeClassIds(nodeId, [...existing, scoped.id])
```

The user never sees `__pb_scope_<nodeId>` — the panel shows it as "Custom styles".

### Rename a class rule

Rule **id** is stable. Renaming is handled by `renameStyleRule` in `src/admin/pages/site/store/styleRuleRename.ts`, which the store wires up via `classSlice.renameClass`. Behavior differs by kind:

- **class-kind**: `assertValidCssClassName` validates the new name, then `name` is updated and `selector` is rebuilt from it via `classKindSelector`. Uniqueness against other class-kind rules is enforced.
- **ambient**: `isValidCssSelector` validates the new selector text, then both `name` and `selector` are updated to the trimmed selector string. Uniqueness is not required (multiple ambient rules can share a selector).

Nodes that reference the rule by id keep working — only the rendered CSS output changes.

### Delete a rule

`useEditorStore.getState().deleteClass(classId)`:

1. Remove the entry from `site.styleRules`.
2. Walk every node and remove the id from `classIds`.
3. (Optional) If the rule is scoped to a now-deleted node, the rule can be GC'd alongside.
