/**
 * Plugin runtime bootstrap — populates `globalThis.__pagebuilder` with the
 * host's React, ReactDOM, JSX runtime, design-system primitives, and
 * plugin SDK builders so the import-map shims in `public/runtime/*.js`
 * can re-export them.
 *
 * Why a global object instead of separate code chunks served by Vite:
 *   1. We need plugins to share the *same* React module instance the
 *      editor uses. Splitting React into its own chunk would still
 *      duplicate React if the chunk wasn't reference-equal — globalThis
 *      makes the sharing explicit.
 *   2. Vite/Rollup's chunk-deduplication is build-time; the plugin's
 *      bundle is loaded at runtime via a path Vite never sees, so we
 *      can't rely on the bundler to dedupe.
 *   3. The shim files are pure ES modules served from `public/runtime/*.js`
 *      — small, hand-auditable, no rollup magic. They re-export from
 *      the global the host populated here.
 *
 * This module is imported once from `src/admin/main.tsx` BEFORE the
 * React tree mounts so any plugin import that happens during the first
 * editor render finds the runtime ready. Subsequent calls are no-ops
 * (idempotent — the global object is replaced wholesale on each call).
 *
 * Safety: never expose host internals beyond what the plugin SDK
 * already documents. The shim files in `public/runtime/` form the
 * narrow contract — anything not re-exported there is private.
