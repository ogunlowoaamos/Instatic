/**
 * useRuntimePreviewBuild — owns the runtime-preview iframe build state.
 *
 * Build trigger contract:
 * - The build rebuilds on any site mutation (debounced by 350ms). Tracked
 *   via `site.updatedAt`, which every site-mutating slice action bumps.
 *   That covers script edits, packageJson edits, page tree edits, class
 *   CSS edits, etc. — i.e. anything the user can change in design mode is
 *   reflected the next time the preview surface renders.
 * - It also rebuilds on context changes that don't mutate the site:
 *     - active page navigation
 *     - active breakpoint navigation
 *     - templateContext (entry currently previewed for templates)
 *     - explicit Refresh action
 *
 * Design rationale:
 * - The hook only runs while the canvas is in preview mode (see
 *   CanvasPreviewSurface). It does NOT run while the user is typing or
 *   dragging in the design canvas — design and preview are mutually
 *   exclusive surfaces. So rebuilding on every site edit doesn't cause
 *   the "scripts re-execute on every keystroke" problem the previous
 *   overlay design suffered from. The 350ms debounce coalesces rapid
 *   external mutations (e.g. agent tool batches).
 *
 * State architecture:
 * - We hold a single `BuildResult` in state, tagged with the
 *   `buildSignature` it was produced for. Stale results from a previous
 *   signature are filtered out during render — no setState in the effect
 *   body just to "blank" the view.
 * - The freshest `site` is read directly from the editor store at fetch
 *   time (via `useEditorStore.getState()`), so we never need a mutable
 *   ref written during render.
