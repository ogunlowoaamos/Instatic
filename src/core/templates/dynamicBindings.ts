/**
 * Dynamic prop binding — resolves runtime values from the publisher's
 * entry stack into a node's static props at render time.
 *
 * The stack semantics are the heart of how templates compose with loops:
 *  - The publisher seeds the stack with the page's primary entry when
 *    rendering a single-entry content template.
 *  - The `base.loop` renderer pushes each iteration's item onto the stack
 *    before recursing into the loop's child subtree, then pops on exit.
 *  - `dynamicBindings.source: 'currentEntry'` always reads the stack top,
 *    i.e. "the closest enclosing entity". Inside a loop nested in a
 *    template, that's the loop iteration; outside the loop it's still
 *    the template entry.
 *  - `dynamicBindings.source: 'parentEntry'` reads one frame below the
 *    top — useful inside a loop nested in a template, where you want to
 *    refer to the outer template entry from inside an iteration.
 *
 * Field lookup is generic: each `LoopItem` carries a `fields` map, and
 * the resolver simply reads `fields[binding.field]`. Format coercions
 * (e.g. markdown → HTML for body bindings with `format: 'html'`) happen
 * here as a thin shim so already-persisted bindings keep working without
 * the source needing to pre-render every variant.
