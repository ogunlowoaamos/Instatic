/**
 * Categories of warnings that the import pipeline can emit.
 *
 * Phase 1 (CSS parser) kinds:
 * - `dropped-at-rule`: an @-rule that the engine can't model was silently
 *   dropped (@keyframes, @font-face, @supports, @container, @layer, etc.).
 * - `unmatched-media-query`: an @media query whose width couldn't be matched
 *   to any defined breakpoint within ±mediaTolerance. Inner declarations are
 *   folded into the base styles so nothing is silently lost.
 * - `invalid-rule`: a rule that the CSS engine rejected (typically a sheet-
 *   level parse error that causes `replaceSync` to throw).
 * - `unknown-property`: legacy — retained for back-compat with any persisted
 *   warnings. The Phase 1a permissive property model no longer emits this; a
 *   declaration is only dropped when its NAME is denied (see
 *   `blocked-property`), not when it's merely uncurated.
 * - `blocked-property`: a CSS declaration whose property name is on the
 *   security denylist (`behavior`, `-moz-binding`, …). Rare. The declaration
 *   is dropped from the rule.
 * - `asset-reference`: informational — a `url(...)` payload was found in a
 *   declaration value. Assets are collected in `assetRefs` (not warnings) by
 *   the Phase 1 parser; this kind is reserved for Phase 2's use.
 * - `duplicate-class`: two `.foo { ... }` rules with the same class selector
 *   appeared in the same file. The later rule's declarations win (CSS cascade
 *   semantics). One warning is emitted per duplicated class.
 * - `scoped-class`: a class name was defined differently across two or more
 *   source stylesheets (each page links its own). To keep every page faithful
 *   to its own CSS, the divergent definitions were scoped to distinct names
 *   (`btn`, `btn-2`, …) and the tokens on the affected pages' nodes + that
 *   stylesheet's selectors were rewritten to match. Nothing is lost; the class
 *   list just gains suffixed names. See `scopeClasses.ts`.
 *
 * Phase 2 (site import pipeline) kinds:
 * - `missing-stylesheet`: a `<link rel="stylesheet">` href referenced in an
 *   HTML file was not found in the FileMap. The page is still imported; the
 *   missing CSS is noted but not fatal.
 * - `asset-upload-failed`: an individual asset upload was rejected by the
 *   media library (e.g. unsupported MIME, oversized file, server error).
 *   The remaining assets continue to upload; the failed file is left
 *   referenced in the source HTML/CSS by its original FileMap path so the
 *   import doesn't degrade pages or rules. Surface the warning in the
 *   wizard's Done step so the user can re-upload manually.
 * - `external-font`: an `@font-face` whose every `src` is an external URL
 *   (or `local(...)` only) — nothing to upload, so the face is skipped rather
 *   than imported. The user can re-add the font by hand. Self-hosted faces
 *   (a bundled `.woff2`/`.woff`/`.ttf`/`.otf`) ARE imported as custom fonts.
